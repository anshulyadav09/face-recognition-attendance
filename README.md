# face-recognition-attendance
Face Recognition Based Attendance System using Streamlit, OpenCV, and face_recognition.
# 🎓 Face Recognition Attendance System

A real-time face recognition-based attendance system built with **Streamlit**, **OpenCV**, and **face_recognition**.  
Users are recognized via webcam, and attendance is logged automatically.

> Powered by `dlib` deep learning models with ~99.38% accuracy on the LFW benchmark.

⚙️ face_recognition Installation Notes
face_recognition requires dlib, which can be tricky to install on some systems.
   Windows
   Use this order:
     pip install cmake
     pip install dlib
     pip install face_recognition

 Or follow a guide like:
     https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/175#issuecomment-368719429

   macOS
     brew install cmake
     pip install dlib
     pip install face_recognition

 📊 Export Attendance
     Admins can export attendance logs by entering the month in YYYY-MM format and clicking "Download Attendance" in the admin panel.


🧠 How It Works
   > Face encodings are generated and saved during registration.
   >  During attendance, each detected face is compared with known encodings.
   > If matched, the user's name and timestamp are stored in attendance.csv.
